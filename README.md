## 1. Create a mobile nav

1. When the browser is at max-width 480px, the `.nav-main` navigation disappears and a "menu" button appears.
2. When you click the "menu" button the navigation appears.
3. When you click the "menu" button again, the navigation disappears.

## 2. Create accordion panels

1. On browser load, the content for each panel is hidden.
2. When you click a panel title, *that* content appears.
3. When you click another panel title, *that* content appears, but the content of any other opened panel disappears.
4. Bonus: when you click an already open panel's title, it closes.

## 3. Sticky plugin

1. Download [sticky.js](https://github.com/garand/sticky) to your js folder.
2. Add the plugin to the page.
3. Make `.nav-internal` sticky.
4. Hide `.nav-internal` when the browser max-width is 480px.
5. Change the `topSpacing` of the plugin to a number greater than 0.
6. Add a `className` for when the nav is stuck. Create a new CSS style for the class to change the look of the nav when it's stuck.
